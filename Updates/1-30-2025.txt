We got the drive train working! Here's how we got there:
1. We installed the NavX2 to the RoboRIO, so we have a working gyro.
2. We updated CAN values in our code so that it communicates properly.
3. We got many errors when trying to run, so we changed the gear ratios from 0 to a random number.
4. We also commented out the path planner methods since they were not initialized.
5. Basically, a lot of bug fixing did the trick.
