We got the drive train working! Here's how we got there:
1. We installed the NavX2 to the RoboRIO, so we have a working gyro.
2. We updated CAN values in our code so that it communicates properly.
3. We got many errors when trying to run, so we changed the gear ratios from 0 to a random number.
4. We also commented out the path planner methods since they were not initialized.
5. Basically, a lot of bug fixing did the trick. 





been digging around in the code, i think we could be missing important lines of code to do things, not sure what kind of code but we might need some
also saw something in Absolutedrive.java about polar angles, might have something to do with the absolute encoder, been trying some diffrent
encoder values aswell
